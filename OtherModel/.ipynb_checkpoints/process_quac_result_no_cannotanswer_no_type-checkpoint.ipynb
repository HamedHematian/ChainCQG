       "['<s>Branch was born on July 2, 1983, in Sedona, Arizona, to David and Peggy Branch. Her father is Irish, and her mother is of Dutch-Indonesian (\"Indo\") and French descent. Her siblings include an older half-brother named David and a younger sister named Nicole. Beginning to sing at the age of three, Branch enrolled in voice lessons at Northern Arizona University when she was eight, and received her first guitar for her fourteenth birthday. After teaching herself chords, she composed her first song \"Fallen\" within a week of receiving her guitar. She initially attended Sedona Red Rock High School, but finished the last two years of her high school education through home schooling so that she could focus on her music career. To support Branch\\'s interests, her parents helped her book local gigs in Sedona, Arizona, and later financed her independent album Broken Bracelet. Her set list at these gigs included covers of songs by Sheryl Crow, Lisa Loeb, Jewel, and Fleetwood Mac. In December 1999, she posted two of her songs on the Rolling Stone website, which caught the attention of both pop rock band Hanson and former Rolling Stone writer and Los Angeles record producer Jeff Rabhan, eventually leading to two gigs opening for Hanson in 2000. In June 2000, Branch self-produced Broken Bracelet, a compilation of songs she wrote when she was 14 and 15; the album was released on the independent record label Twin Dragon Records. Its title was inspired from a bracelet made by pop singer Jewel, given to Branch by musician Steve Poltz at a Lisa Loeb concert she attended. Poltz told Branch that \"when it breaks, you\\'ll be famous.\" The Broken Bracelet recordings were destroyed in the Nashville floods in May 2010. {hl_token}CANNOTANSWER{hl_token}',\n",
